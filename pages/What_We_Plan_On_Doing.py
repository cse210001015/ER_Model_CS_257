For example, in our IIT, if a new CR is to be elected for a batch or a new President for the entire Gymkhana is to be elected, then the system would be able to do that. Not only that, if someone wants to make a decision based on reviews of others, like having some extra batch class, then he would be able to do that. The system will be easy to use, like google forms.")
